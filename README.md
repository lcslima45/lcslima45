ðŸŽ“ I'm Computer Engineer gratuated on Federal University of CearÃ¡.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning tools for distributed systems in Go like gRPC and web framekworks for development on Back-end. I'm doing some projects in Javascript as Front-end web development tool.
ðŸ”­ I have 3 years of experience with projects using Go on Back-end as the main language of the stack. I like Go because it is simple but seems like C and Python, and I like both. Go gives me a powerful standard library to develop good apps. 
ðŸ”­ I have proficiency with Python as I used this programming  language as the tool to build applications on the college and I did some research on Generative Adversarial models to generate images from satele. This research gave me some experience with Tensorflow and Deep Learning models for generating images.
âš¡ Fun fact: I like to play guitar but this has nothing to do with programming languages.
