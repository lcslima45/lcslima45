🎓 I'm Computer Engineering Student at Universidade Federal do Ceará.
🔭 I’m currently working with Go Backend development. I like Go because it is simple but seems like C and Python, and I like both. Go gives me a powerful standard library to develop good apps. 
⚡ Fun fact: I like to play guitar but this has nothing to do with programming languages.
